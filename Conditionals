Given an integer, , perform the following conditional actions:

If n is odd, print Weird
If n is even and in the inclusive range of 2 to 5 , print Not Weird
If n is even and in the inclusive range of 6 to 20 , print Weird
If n  is even and greater than 20 , print Not Weird

test case: 3 and 24

solution:
N = int(input().strip()) 
if N % 2 == 1: 
    print("Weird") 
elif N < 6 or N > 20: 
    print("Not Weird") 
else: 
    print("Weird")
